# Water Ring Toss Game

A web-based recreation of the classic handheld water ring toss game, where players use buttons to make rings fly and land on a central peg. Built with HTML, p5.js, and JavaScript, this game is playable on both PC and mobile devices with a nostalgic design and improved graphics.

## Features
- **Gameplay**: Press "Push Left" or "Push Right" buttons to make all rings fly upward with a left or right bias. Use arrow keys (PC) or device tilt (mobile) to guide rings to the peg.
- **Objective**: Stack all five rings on the central peg to win. A "You Win!" message appears, followed by a "Play Again" button to restart.
- **Graphics**: Vibrant hollow rings (not balls), water gradient background, bubble effects, and a textured peg for a retro aesthetic.
- **Controls**:
  - **PC**: Arrow keys for left/right tilt, click round "Push Left" and "Push Right" buttons at the bottom.
  - **Mobile**: Device tilt for left/right movement, touch buttons for ring movement.
- **Play Again**: Rectangular "Play Again" button at the top appears after winning to reset the game.
- **Responsive**: Canvas adjusts to screen size for seamless play on any device.
